      <h2>Our Focus is on Holistic Healing</h2>
      <p>
        True healing considers the whole person and not just their parts. The healing process involves acknowledging and
        confronting past wounds, learning to reframe negative thought patterns, and developing coping strategies to manage
        emotions and behaviors.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not always linear, and setbacks may occur, but with persistence and kindness toward oneself, individuals can
        cultivate resilience, foster personal growth, and move towards a more fulfilling and meaningful life.

        <h2>How Online Therapy Helps</h2>
        <p>
          The first and foremost purpose of online therapy is to give you 
          <span class="highlight">a safe space for disclosure.</span> 
          In your online therapy journey, you will know what an uninterrupted conversation feels like. 
          It's easier to open up because you feel not judged but understood. Further, online counselling 
          helps <span class="highlight">identify triggers</span> for your emotions and allows you to 
          <span class="highlight">discover your deep-rooted concerns.</span> With trusted counselor guidance 
          and practical tools, <span class="highlight">you will feel better, happier, and stronger at every step.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can improve relationships, build confidence, overcome peer pressure, cope with stress, 
          beat anxiety, and outgrow depression. It will empower you with skill sets to 
          <span class="highlight">become the best version of yourself.</span>

          In 2009, Vandrewala Foundation established a mental health helpline in
          India that provided free psychological counselling and crisis
          intervention for anyone feeling anxious, depressed, stressed, lonely,
          suicidal, or simply struggling to cope.
